# üß† Distributed Selenium Grid with Docker & Azure

This project demonstrates how to set up a **Selenium Grid 4** environment using **Docker containers** deployed across multiple **Azure Virtual Machines** for true distributed, cross-browser testing.

The Grid consists of a **central Hub** and multiple browser **Nodes** (Chrome and Firefox) that register themselves automatically and advertise their capabilities. Tests are routed by the Hub to the appropriate Node based on browser requirements, enabling **parallel execution** across multiple environments.

The accompanying **Java + JUnit 5** test suite shows how to connect to the Grid using **RemoteWebDriver**, run functional tests on both browsers, and automatically generate interactive **Extent Reports** with embedded screenshots for failed tests.

This project is ideal for automation engineers and QA professionals who want to learn how to:

* Build scalable, cloud-based Selenium test infrastructure
* Deploy and connect Nodes across VMs in Azure
* Integrate **Extent Reports** for rich HTML reporting
* Execute parallel, data-driven tests with minimal configuration

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

* Selenium Grid 4.22
* Docker & Docker Compose
* Java 17 / JUnit 5
* Extent Reports (HTML reporting)
* Azure Virtual Machines (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)

---

## üöÄ Features

* Centralized Hub with Chrome & Firefox Nodes
* Automatic screenshot capture on failure
* Parallel test execution across multiple VMs
* Clean Extent Reports in `target/extent/extent.html`
* Fully scripted Docker setup for repeatable deployments

---

## üåê Outcome

A production-grade, containerized Selenium Grid that integrates into CI/CD pipelines to support reliable, scalable, and visually rich end-to-end UI testing.

Would you like me to add a **"Quick Start"** section next (with the exact commands to deploy the Hub and Nodes in Azure)? That‚Äôs often the most-clicked section on GitHub READMEs.
